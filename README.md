I used the template for the meteor client addon thing on github so check them out if you want. Also this is majority vibe coded so there could be possible errors. Also majority of these modules are just ripped directly from glazed and updated to 1.21.8. Enjoy :)

Current Modules:
 - Legit totem (Opens your inventory on a delay (strict or random) and proceedes to equip a totem in your offhand)
 - Fast Crystal (when holding a crystal while holding right click it will act as if you are clicking quickly)
 - Air Pocket Finder (Will find 1x1 air pockets underground to see if there has been any human interference)
 - Coord Copier (When activated copies your current coords but at least for me it doesnt work fully so it copies it to a persistent notepad within the settings of the module)
 - Crystal Macro (will automatically click on a crystal when looking at one on a delay (strict or random))
 - Rotated Deepslate Finder (Uses nearly the same thing as the Air Pocket Finder but finds Deepslate which is rotated)
